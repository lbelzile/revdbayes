## Resubmission

This is a resubmission.  In this version I have:

* corrected Ratio-of-uniforms to Ratio-of-Uniforms in the Title field of 
  DESCRIPTION (and also in the vignette).

* Single quoted the package names 'rust', 'evdbayes' and `revdbayes' in 
  the Description. [Sorry, I should have got this correct on the first try!]
  I have also changed MCMC to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies

This is a new submission.
