Description: Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of extreme value
    models.  The 'rust' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rust> is
    used to simulate a random sample from the required posterior distribution.
    The functionality of 'revdbayes' is similar to the 'evdbayes' package
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=evdbayes>, which uses Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo ('MCMC') methods for posterior simulation.  See the 'revdbayes' 
    website for more information, documentation and examples.
